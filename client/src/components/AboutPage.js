                <img className="brothers-image" src={brothers} alt="two brothers having some wine" />

                <p> In 1882 two brothers were playing the popular French game
                    called Boules when one of their balls made a dent in the wall of
                    the restaurant they were renovating.<br></br><br></br>They had not decided on a name
                    for their new establishment, but decided there and then that the name would be <i>Boules au Mur</i>, which means “balls to the wall”.<br></br><br></br>This would combine their love of the
                    ball game with their passion for food.<br></br><br></br>They opened the restaurant in a small French
                    village, Asnières-sur-Nouère, and it was a roaring success. The brothers franchised their business and the love
                    of good food they brought to their menus is still found in Boules au Mur restaurants around
                    the globe. </p>
